<p>ElderCare is a web-based management system designed to assist in the daily operations of old age homes by
                bringing compassion, organization, and ease of use into one elegant platform. Developed as part of a
                community connect initiative, this project aims to support caregivers and staff in delivering better,
                more efficient care to elderly residents through intuitive digital tools.

                In traditional caregiving environments, recordkeeping and coordination are often done manually, leading
                to inefficiencies, missed medications, or lost resident data. ElderCare solves these challenges by
                offering a centralized platform to manage everything from resident information and staff details to
                health records and emergency contacts — all within a visually calming and user-friendly interface.

                The project emphasizes a gentle, emotionally resonant design — inspired by soft pastel color palettes
                (like mint green and cherry blossom pink) — to make users feel at ease while maintaining a professional
                tone. It is intentionally crafted to avoid the clinical, sterile feel of hospital management systems and
                instead focuses on warmth, accessibility, and clarity.
